        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <span id="letter">
        <p>I am a game developer and an educator. All of my games <del>that are supposedly here</del> are freeware. I also teach courses in the fields of <i>Multimedia Arts and Game Development.</i></p>
        <p>As you can see, you have come to a "textual space". Over the months, things have been overwhelming ever since I entered a teaching career. Teaching has been so influential, believe it, or not. <i>Life-changing.</i></p>
        <p>The point is, there's nothing wrong with moving away from "this area" in a while. I'll spend lots of time and effort making games.</p>
        <p><i>When I return, there will be lots of new games to be played. It'll be something way different than before.</i></p>
        <hr>

        <p>See you soon, feel free to contact via E-mail, and to play my games:</p>
