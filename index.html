        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <span id="letter">
        <p>I am a game developer focusing on the Web. All of my games <del>that are supposedly here</del> are freeware, meaning <b>you can play them for FREE</b>. I also teach courses, related to Multimedia Arts and Game Development, in different schools.</p>
        <p>As you can see, you have come to a work in progress space. And of course, I am still making video games (since 2008). But I figure that I need to spend way more time preparing the website. Things have been juggling ever since I discovered that teaching is also part of my life. I teach not only to make them learn, but also to influence them on how I handle my skills and abilities.</p>
        <p>In fact, there's nothing wrong to move away in "this area" for a while. When I return, there will be lots of new games to be played. It'll be something way different than before. Not to mention that I need to share <del>or dump</del> some artworks here too, for more interest.</p>
        <p>I hope you'll understand, just be patient for some time. Thanks for reading.</p>
